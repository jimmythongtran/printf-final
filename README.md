# This project creates the printf function.
**The main files of the project are:**
0. holberton.h<br>
1. _printf.c<br>
  * print_funcs.c
  * print_number.c
  * _putchar.c
2. main.c

  I chose to organize to present the file structure this way
  because: I consider the the header file as the zero - the proverbial
  chicken that gives birth to all the eggs (function prototypes). Then
  _printf.c is the motherboard which needs the other according print_funcs
  and print_number functions. main.c is the test file.
